Course Project repository.

- `CodeBook.md` - code book that describes the variables
- `run_analysis.R` - R language script
- `tidy_dataset.txt` - a tidy data set
- `README.md` - repo description

## run_analysis.R
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
